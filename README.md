Computer Assisted Dental Identification System (ODONTECH)

This concept & Project aims at developing a computer assisted dental identification system that cater to need of people and dentists. So we aim to implement such a system that allows the users to have facility at any place, access the required information and also predicts / forecasts possible conclusions based on the parameters.

To build a computer assisted dental identification system which predicts the possible and probable identification of individuals based on historic, current ,ante mortem and post mortem dental records.
There are numerous parameters required to build a framework that forecasts confirmation of individual identity some List of parameters to be considered for evaluating AM & PM data:
1.	Filling
•	Lingual
•	Buccal / incisal
•	Palatal
•	Mesial
•	Distal
•	Occlusal
•	Buccal extension
•	Lingual / Palatal extension
•	Mesio occlusal
•	Disto occlusal
•	Mesio occlusal distal
•	Cervical caries / filling
2.	Carious
•	Grossly decayed
•	Lingual
•	Buccal / incisal
•	Palatal
•	Mesial
•	Distal
•	Occlusal
•	Buccal extension
•	Lingual / Palatal extension
•	Mesio occlusal
•	Disto occlusal
•	Mesio occlusal distal
•	Cervical caries / filling
Surfaces may be filled or carious/decayed 
Type of restorations / filling
•	Composite
•	Amalgam
•	RC treated tooth [Root Canal Treated]
•	Inlay
•	on lay
3.	Missing
4.	Intact
5.	Supernumery teeth
Usually mentioned if exists
6.	Implant / Complete Denture / partial denture
7.	Spacing
8.	 Crown & Bridge
•	Ceramic
•	Metal crowns
•	PFM [ Porcelain fused metal crown]
•	Veneers [not for bridge]
9.	Stains
•	+
•	++
•	+++ 
Applicable only if patients adverse habits / use of tobacco etc.
10.	Mobile
•	Grade I
•	Grade II
•	Grade III
11.	Tilted / Inclined / Rotated
•	Mesially Tilted 
•	Distally Tilted
•	Buccally Tilted 
•	LinguallyPalatally Inclined
12.	Eruption [ Canines & 3rd molars]
•	Buccally erupted
13.	Fracture
•	Ellis class I
•	Ellis class II
•	Ellis class III
•	Ellis Class IX
14.	Fracture Screws (if Radiographs / X-Rays Available) 
•	ZMC
•	Mandibular
•	lefort I/II/III
•	FZ  
•	Others
By considering all the above parameters as input and rigorously comparing it with the pm records we can easily draw a conclusion based on the match. 
RESEARCH PROBLEM: 
	To identify the parameters for building a framework that proves conformation of identity of an individuals based on ante mortem and post mortem dental records.
	To impalement and to apply data mining techniques on these patients large data sets to arrive at possible predictions.


APPLICATIONS & MERITS OF THE SYSTEM:
1.	In Forensic odontology / dentistry to confirm the identity of individuals
2.	Developing and maintain the real time large databases of AM& PM
3.	In mass Disasters & natural calamities 
4.	In forensic pathology


 DEMERITS OF THE SYSTEM:
1.	Non availability of real time ante mortem records
2.	Dental features may change with time, Specifically if PM data or images were captured after long time after AM captured, that will cause difficulty  in matching  


The CADIS ensures that the system features meet the user requirements. User requirements have been translated into system characteristics. The information system meets user needs by accomplishing the following.
1. Performs the right procedures properly.
2. Presents information and instructions in an acceptable an effective fashion.
3. Produces accurate results.
4. Provides an acceptable interface and method of interaction.
5. Perceived by users as a reliable system.


ROLE OF FORENSIC DENTISTS:
Forensic dentists, are responsible for main areas of practices such as:
• Identification of found human remains
• Identification in mass fatalities
• Assessment of bite mark injuries
• Assessment of cases of abuse (child, spouse, elder)
• Civil cases involving malpractice
• Age estimation
